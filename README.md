# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce App using Next.js and PERN Stack Project 2025

## Overview
A modern multi-vendor e-commerce application built with Next.js (React) on the frontend and the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node) for full-stack capabilities. Designed for extensibility, vendor management, product catalogs, order processing, and admin analytics.

## Key Features
- Multi-vendor onboarding and vendor dashboards
- Product catalog with categories, tags, and media
- Shopping cart and checkout with order management
- Role-based authentication (customers, vendors, admins)
- REST API backend with PostgreSQL persistence
- Server-side rendering and API routes via Next.js
- Basic analytics and reporting for vendors/admins
- Secure environment variable management and migrations

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (or styled-components)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM/Query: Prisma or Sequelize (configurable)
- Auth: JWT + secure refresh tokens (or NextAuth for SSO)
- Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Jest/React Testing Library

## Architecture
- Next.js handles SSR/SSG and frontend routing.
- Express provides RESTful API endpoints (microservices-friendly).
- PostgreSQL stores relational data (users, vendors, products, orders).
- Optional: Redis for caching and background job queue (e.g., Bull).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL >= 12
- (Optional) Redis for caching/jobs

### Environment Variables
Create a .env (example):
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
- PORT=3000

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   - npm install
3. Set up the database and run migrations
   - Using Prisma: npx prisma migrate deploy
   - Or run SQL/migration tool of choice
4. Seed initial data (vendors, admin user) if provided

### Running Locally
- Development (frontend + backend):
  - npm run dev
- Build & Production:
  - npm run build
  - npm start

### Testing
- Unit & integration tests:
  - npm test
- Frontend tests:
  - npm run test:ui

## Deployment
- Recommended: Vercel for Next.js frontend; Heroku, Railway, or a Docker-based host for backend & Postgres.
- Use CI/CD to run tests and migrations before deployment.
- Configure environment variables securely in the host.

## Contributing
- Follow repository issue and PR templates.
- Write tests for new features and run linters before committing.
- Keep changes modular and document public APIs.
